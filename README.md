# Productivity

## Abstract

Any Engineer worth their salt recognises what all physicists already know.  All things (including those things outside of work) are interconnected (and often dependent) systems.  This repo is a gathering of research, thoughts and ideas to optimise the systems that a productive day depends on.

**NB:** I am not a medical or research professional.  Much of the content below is taken from others research and I will endeavour to include citations where possible.  If you disagree with it, or 

## Time

#### Truths

* You should always be willing to revise an opinion based on better data (empirical evidence you can verify for yourself).
* No regular human is capable of more than 4 hours deeply focused work in a standard 8 hour work day. We have a finite amount of attention we can burn.
* Humans need downtime. It is not reasonable to expect them to be available 7 days a week or 24 hours a day. Productivity always falls in these circumstances. Without exception. If you don’t believe so, you need to start measuring or improve your metrics.
* It is better to be fundamentally productive 24 hours per week than to be diffuse in your output over 90 hours a week.

#### Recommendations

* Respect the importance of the time slots you allocate.

#### Scheduled Productivity Blocks

#### Review

#### Focus

### Email

#### Truths

* 

#### Recommendations

* It's important to change the mindset of how to deal with email and IM.
* It’s up to an email sender to convince you to respond.
* Only open email and IM applications at scheduled times of day <link>.
* Use sender filters.

##### Email processing 

* Be merciless.
* Process email into the 4 x Ds then assign Eisenhower categories to the ‘Do’ bucket.

```
Delete
	Action: Move to archive.
Do
	Urgent and Important
	    Action: Deal immediately, then archive the mail once the issue has been addressed.
	Urgent but not important
	    Low effort:
	        Action: Deal immediately.
	    High effort: 
	        Action: Deal immediately or send a holding email until you have sufficient time to address the issue during the next available email or shallow work time window.
	Important but not urgent
	    Low effort:
	        Action: Deal immediately.
	    High effort:
	        Action: Set reminder to process during an email or shallow work window within the next 4 working days.
	Not Important or Urgent
	    Low effort:
	        Action: Deal immediately.
	    High effort: 
	        Action: Fall through to the Defer bucket.
Delegate
	Action: Forward email to delegate (with instructions, if required), then archive the mail.
Defer
	Action: Set a future reminder, then archive the mail.

```

**NB:** Low effort <= 5 - 10 minutes.
        High effort > 10 minutes.
